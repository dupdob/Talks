Cyrille started coding in hus early teens, on 8 bit computers; never stopped since. He had enjoyed various roles throughout my careers in IT and is currently a senior software architect for an investment bank. Convinced that our field is still in its infancy, he strongly believes that developers/coders/IT professionals need to push the envelope further and strive to improve our practices and push us to the next maturity level. That conviction pushed him to join the software Craftsmanship movement, while recognizing this is just a step on this long journey.

He has significant expertise in distributed systems, concurrency, software and systems design, messaging (solution and patterns), software performance and mechanical sympathy. He has extensive knowledge of C#/C++, OS architecture, especialy Windows.

He had talked a couple of times at conference (Devoxx Paris) and meetups, and he loves speaking at BBLs, giving hom the opportunity to discover new work culture and practices as well engage with fellow developers.
