Cyrille started coding in my early teens, on 8 bit computers. Never stopped since. He had enjoyed various roles throughout my careers in IT and is currently a senior software architect for an investment bank. Convinced that our field is still in its infancy, he strongly believes that we, developers/coders/IT professionals, need to push the envelope further and strive to improve our practices and push us to the next maturity level. That conviction pushed him to join the software Craftsmanship movement, while recognizing this is just a step on this long journey.

I have strong expertise in distributed systems, concurrency, software and systems design, messaging (solution and patterns), software performance and mechanical sympathy. I have extensive knowledge of C#/C++, OS architecture, especialy Windows.

I have talked a couple of times at conference (Devoxx Paris) and meetups, and I love speaking at a BBL, as it gives me the opportunity to discover new work culture and practices and engage with fellow developers.
