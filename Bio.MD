**Cyrille** started coding in his early teens, on 8 bit computers; never stopped since. He had enjoyed various roles throughout his career and is currently a **senior software architect for a bank**. Convinced that coding is still in its infancy, he strongly believes that developers/coders/IT professionals need to push the envelope further and strive to improve their practices and push to the next maturity level. That conviction pushed him to join the **Software Craftsmanship** movement, while recognizing this is just a step on **his long journey**. He also helped many peers along that way.

He has significant expertise in _distributed systems, concurrency, software and systems design, messaging (solution and patterns), software performance and mechanical sympathy_. He has extensive knowledge of C#/C++, OS architecture, especialy Windows.

He had talked a couple of times at conference (Devoxx Paris) and meetups, and he loves **speaking at BBLs**, giving him the opportunity to discover new work culture and practices as well engage with fellow developers.
