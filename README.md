# Bio
I started coding in my early teens, on 8 bit computers. Never stopped since. I have enjoyed various roles throughout my careers in IT and currently I am a senior software architect at a large investment bank.
Convinced that our field is still in its infancy, I strongly believed we, developers/coders/IT professionals, need to push the envelope further and strive to improve our practices and push us to the next maturity level.
That conviction pushed me to join the software Craftsmanship movement, while recognizing this is just a step on this long journey.

I have strong expertise in distributed systems, concurrency, software and systems design, messaging (solution and patterns), software performance and mechanical sympathy. I have extensive knowledge of C#/C++, OS architecture, especialy Windows.

I have talked a couple of times at conference (Devoxx Paris) and meetups, and I love speaking at a BBL, as it gives me the opportunity to discover new work
culture and practices and engage with fellow developers.

# BBLs
This is a list of topics that are adapted to the BBL format.

## Lego Craftsmanship
This BBL is an introduction to Software Craftsmanship, offering
first hand experience of what is simplicity, Test Driven Development as well as Technical Debt.
Based on series of Lego based exercises, this session generates engagement
through sheer fun.
