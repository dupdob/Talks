# Endangered Species: _Senior Craftsmen_
You have probably more influence than you realize. You can influence others, impact our industry, the life of others, even the World itself. Let me show you **why, where and how**.

If you are attending **NCraft**, you probably already have significant experience, knowledge, best practices and whatsnot.
And you already help your colleagues and spread your knowledge to your peers. 

But you are among **rare** beasts, and you are key for others:
* _Junior ones_ need your help.
* _Experienced ones_ need your leadership.
* _Everyone_ one needs your experience, expertise and creativity.

If you are ready to **leave your comfort zone to do more**,
I will explain to you why **IT needs you** as well as where and how you can help.
And of course, it will be **a fun ride** all along!
